        <h1>American Tourist Site Recommendations</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>  
                We will be working to answer the question of how we can facilitate the decision-making process for people who are trying to decide where they want to travel in the United States. We will be working on a website in which users can input a state, and then we suggest tourist attractions such as restaurants, museums, parks, or any natural scenery. This solves the common problem of vacation-seekers/travelers having to explore numerous websites just to arrive at state travel decisions, as well as finding potential locations of interest. We want one organized website, so that users can efficiently decide which location they want to visit after comparing it with other states they input. This proposed website will hopefully make planning easier for those who want to explore the country.

            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                A big problem when deciding where you want to travel is that conventional travel websites have not created a single platform for those who want to find all the tourist attractions across different states in America. Most likely, someone who wants to travel somewhere will often explore various websites just to arrive at a decision. Maybe, they will do a simple google search on say, Wisconsin. And if they're also thinking of Maryland, they will do another search for it as well. However, this becomes tiring and repetitive when people are wanting to explore 5 states, or even more. And even worse, what if they want to find 3-5 locations or attractions for each state? It is quite possible that people doing these kinds of searches are having as many as 15 opened tabs on their browser. This becomes overbearing; it would be so much better if one website organized all these states and locations in a way that is easily-digestible.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>
                Sure, you can individually google tourist attractions from different states, but this can be tedious. We want one platform that can help users compare different locations and decide where they want to go. Also, there are some travel based websites that individually list a single travel site from all 50 states, or arrange big tours across many different travel locations, but none of these websites such as the websites listed below provide users with the option of choosing which type of travel site such as museums, parks, or restaurants that they want to visit.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>
                Our intended users are any travelers around the world who intend on finding some places to visit during their trip in United States. These could also just be American citizens who want to explore other states. They can find out about the greatest natural scenery, historical sites, museums, national parks, or other local areas and mark their destinations clean and efficiently. We will also recommend local businesses such as restaurants and mom-and-pop shops, which may help underrepesented communities and minority-owned businesses.
            </p>

            <p>
            Our users can:
            <ol>
            <li>Type in the state(s) they are interested in exploring</li>
            <li>Choose a category of tourist destination (park, museum, restaurant, historical site, etc) </li>
            <li>They can also mark their favorite sites and see them in their "saved" collection later.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
            The users will be viewing the names and images of the tourist sites,as well as the location in the states. They can also read about the description of the tourist sites to decide if they're interested. Our resources come from the tourist sites csv datasets and we will generalize the critical information that are most useful for our users. With clear layout and orginized information, our user can easily find nice places in their intended traveling destination(s) and more efficiently plan their vacation. 
            </p>

            <p>
                By recommending potential destination spots for each requested state from the user, our website will help them quickly identify interesting places to visit. Rather than having to open multiple tabs for each state and location, and being overwhelmed with having to switch between them, users can instead focus on one whole page with every state and destination of interest.
