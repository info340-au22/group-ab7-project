        <h1>American Tourist Site Recommendations</h1>
        <section>
            <h2> Overview</h2>
            <p>We will be working to answer the question of how we can facilitate the decision-making process for people who are trying to decide where they want to travel. We will be working on a website in which users can input a state, and then we suggest tourist attractions such as restaurants, museums, parks, or any natural scenery. We want one organized website, so that users can efficiently decide which location they want to visit after comparing it with other states they input.</p>

            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>A big problem when deciding where you want to travel is that conventional travel websites have not created a single platform for those who want to find all the tourist attractions across different states in America. </p>

            <h2>Proposed application</h2>
            <p>Sure, you can individually google tourist attractions from different states, but this can be tedious. We want one platform that can help users compare different locations and decide where they want to go. Also, there are some travel based websites that individually list a single travel site from all 50 states, or arrange big tours across many different travel locations, but none of these websites such as the websites listed below provide users with the option of choosing which type of travel site such as museums, parks, or restaurants that they want to visit.</p>
