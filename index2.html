          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            We will be working to answer the question of how we can facilitate the decision-making process for people who are trying to decide where they want to travel in the United States. We will be working on a website in which users can input a state, and then we suggest tourist attractions such as restaurants, museums, parks, or any natural scenery. This solves the common problem of vacation-seekers/travelers having to explore numerous websites just to arrive at state travel decisions, as well as finding potential locations of interest. We want one organized website, so that users can efficiently decide which location they want to visit after comparing it with other states they input. This proposed website will hopefully make planning easier for those who want to explore the country.

          <h2>Problem Description</h2>
          <p>
            A big problem when deciding where you want to travel is that conventional travel websites have not created a single platform for those who want to find all the tourist attractions across different states in America. Most likely, someone who wants to travel somewhere will often explore various websites just to arrive at a decision. Maybe, they will do a simple google search on say, Wisconsin. And if they're also thinking of Maryland, they will do another search for it as well. However, this becomes tiring and repetitive when people are wanting to explore 5 states, or even more. And even worse, what if they want to find 3-5 locations or attractions for each state? It is quite possible that people doing these kinds of searches are having as many as 15 opened tabs on their browser. This becomes overbearing; it would be so much better if one website organized all these states and locations in a way that is easily-digestible.

          <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
          <p>
            Sure, you can individually google tourist attractions from different states, but this can be tedious. We want one platform that can help users compare different locations and decide where they want to go. Also, there are some travel based websites that individually list a single travel site from all 50 states, or arrange big tours across many different travel locations, but none of these websites such as the websites listed below provide users with the option of choosing which type of travel site such as museums, parks, or restaurants that they want to visit.
